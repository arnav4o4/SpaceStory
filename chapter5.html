            As the world’s leading scientists gathered in secret, there was only one plan that stood a chance. The
            second object was fast approaching, and Apophis was no longer their primary concern. The new
            object — identified as an alien spacecraft — was unlike anything they’d prepared for.
        </p>
        <p>
            "All space agencies are coordinating, but we need more time," Commander Harris said as he and Ava
            relayed the data to the agencies. The ISS crew had one job: to disable the spacecraft before it
            reached Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            "We have one shot at this," Ava said, her voice cracking under the pressure. "Our missile systems
            weren’t designed for this. If we miscalculate..."
        </p>
        <p>
            Harris interrupted, "We won’t miss."
        </p>
        <p>
            The crew hurried to arm the only missile available on board. As it launched, they watched in silence,
            knowing it had to strike true. But time was running out. As the missile approached the object, Harris
            and Ava held their breath.
        </p>
        <p>
            The screen flickered. “Direct hit!” someone shouted. But their celebration was short-lived. The object
            slowed but didn’t stop. Its course was altered, and it veered into Apophis. What followed was a
            massive explosion that could be seen from space.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the collision wasn’t enough. Pieces of Apophis and the alien craft rained down toward Earth.
            The disaster was far from over.
