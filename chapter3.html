            The briefing room was filled with tension. The team had been working tirelessly, trying to come up with a 
            plan to deflect the asteroid. Each proposal seemed more desperate than the last.
        </p>
        <p>
            "We need a solution," Ava said, her voice strained. Her eyes darted across the room as she leaned over the table, pointing to the holographic display. "And we need it fast."
        </p>
        <p>
            Commander Harris paced back and forth, reviewing the data on the screen. "What if we used a nuclear device?" he suggested. "It could alter the asteroid’s trajectory."
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava shook her head. "It’s risky. The calculations show a high probability of fragmentation, which could create multiple threats." She brought up a simulation, showing the potential for the asteroid to break into dozens of smaller, yet still dangerous, fragments that would rain down on Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            "But we don’t have the luxury of time," Harris replied, his voice tight with frustration. "Every second we wait, it gets closer. We need to make a decision now."
        </p>
        <p>
            The room fell silent for a moment, the weight of the situation pressing down on everyone present. Dr. Ellis, who had been quietly observing from the corner, finally spoke up. "There might be another way."
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava and Harris turned toward him. "Go on," Ava prompted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ellis hesitated for a moment, then stepped forward. "We’ve been developing a gravitational tractor system. It's still in its early stages, but in theory, it could pull the asteroid off course without the risk of fragmentation."
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava’s eyes widened. "But we’d need time to get the equipment in place, and we’re running low on fuel and resources up here. Can we make it work?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "We can retrofit what we have on the station," Ellis said, determination flashing in his eyes. "It’s a long shot, but it’s our best bet to avoid total disaster."
        </p>
        <p>
            Harris sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. "We’ve got one chance. If this doesn’t work…"
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava nodded grimly. "We know. Let’s get to work."
