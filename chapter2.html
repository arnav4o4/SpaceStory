            The control room was in chaos. Red lights flashed everywhere, casting eerie shadows on the metallic
            walls of the station. Sirens blared as data screens flickered with lines of incomprehensible numbers.
            Commander Harris had never seen such panic from mission control before. Despite being hundreds
            of miles above Earth, he could feel the tension crackling in the air, growing heavier by the second.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What are they trying to hide from us?" he whispered, almost to himself. His voice barely broke
            through the cacophony of alarms. His heart raced, matching the frantic pace of the flashing lights.
            Sweat beaded on his forehead despite the cold, sterile environment of the ISS.
        </p>
        <p>
            "It’s not just an asteroid," Ava said, her voice trembling as she leaned closer to her monitor, the faint
            glow of the screens reflecting in her wide, worried eyes. "There’s more... something happened."
        </p>
        <p>
            Her fingers moved over the console, bringing up a series of images, her face growing pale with each
            passing second. "This can’t be right," she muttered, shaking her head in disbelief. "Apophis was
            supposed to pass by safely. All the data, all the models... they were sure."
        </p>
        <p>
            Harris floated to her side, trying to make sense of the garbled transmissions and data feeds. His gut
            told him something was very, very wrong. He glanced at the Earth through the viewport, its vast blue
            and white expanse deceptively calm, as though mocking the chaos inside the ISS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, the monitors blinked, showing an unsettling image. Apophis—a massive, shadowy rock
            hurtling through space—but behind it, looming in the background, was something else. A second
            object. Larger. Faster. And utterly alien. It moved with an unnatural precision, too smooth for any
            known celestial body.
        </p>
        <p>
            One that no one had predicted.
        </p>
        <p>
            A chilling silence fell over the control room as Ava zoomed in on the object. The details became
            sharper, revealing an irregular surface—metallic in places, reflecting faint light from the distant Sun.
            It wasn’t just a rock. "This isn’t a natural object," she whispered, her voice barely audible. "It’s...
            manufactured."
        </p>
        <p>
            Harris felt a knot tighten in his chest. The implications were staggering. "You’re saying it’s... a
            spacecraft?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava's eyes never left the screen. "Either it’s coming for us... or we’ve been lied to all along."
        </p>
