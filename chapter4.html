        <p>
            The room remained tense as the team worked tirelessly to retrofit the station’s equipment for the
            gravitational tractor. Time was not on their side. Apophis loomed closer with every passing hour, its
            course unchanged. The crew had no time to rest — it was now or never.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly, a new alert flashed on the station's main control screen. The crew’s attention shifted, and
            Ava’s eyes widened as she read the incoming data. "What... what is this?" she whispered.
        </p>
        <p>
            Commander Harris, standing over her shoulder, stared at the data in disbelief. "It’s not Apophis," he
            muttered. "This is something else."
        </p>
        <p>
            The screens showed a second object, much larger and faster than Apophis, hurtling toward Earth. Its
            course was unmistakably a collision trajectory, and it was gaining speed. Unlike Apophis, this object
            didn’t resemble any asteroid they had ever encountered.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava ran several scans, her fingers trembling as she processed the results. "This can’t be right... its
            surface... it’s metallic. And the shape... it’s too irregular. This isn’t a natural object." She looked up, her
            voice barely above a whisper. "It’s manufactured."
        </p>
        <p>
            Harris’ face paled as the weight of the realization sank in. "Are you saying… it’s a spacecraft?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I don’t know," Ava replied. "But it’s not from Earth, that’s for sure."
        </p>
        <p>
            The gravity of the situation deepened. Apophis, once thought to be the primary threat, was now
            overshadowed by this new object. Its rapid approach left little time for preparation, and whatever it
            was, it wasn’t friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dr. Ellis hurried to the console, scanning the incoming signals. "This thing is moving too fast. We
            need to alert mission control on Earth. If we don’t act fast, this could be a global extinction-level
            event."
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava’s heart raced as she opened a comm link, desperately trying to re-establish contact with the
            Earth-based space agencies. But all she received was static. "Damn it," she cursed under her breath.
            "We’re still cut off."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Keep trying," Harris ordered. "We need to warn them. If Apophis wasn’t enough to destroy Earth,
            this thing will finish the job."
        </p>
        <p>
            As the crew scrambled to interpret the new data, the station’s limited resources strained under the
            pressure of the dual threats. Apophis was still approaching Earth, and now this unknown object was
            closing in rapidly.
        </p>
        <p>
            "We need a plan, now!" Harris barked. "We can’t fight both threats at once."
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava’s mind raced, but her thoughts kept returning to the unknown object. It was too advanced, too
            precise to be an accident. "We might be dealing with more than just a random asteroid strike," she
            said. "This could be deliberate."
        </p>
        <p>
            Harris shot her a concerned look. "You mean... we could be under attack?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava nodded slowly. "And if that’s the case, then Apophis might have been just a distraction."
        </p>
        <p>
            As they struggled to comprehend the magnitude of what they were facing, the clock continued ticking.
            Earth’s fate now hung in the balance, and the ISS crew knew they were running out of time.
