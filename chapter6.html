            The international space station was eerily quiet, a ghost of its former self. Dust coated every surface, and the control
            room was barely functional. Ava and Harris wasted no time as they rushed to power up the railgun
            system, their final hope to save Earth from the deadly debris.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the base systems hummed to life, warning lights blinked. The control panel flashed red. "It’s not
            enough," Ava muttered, her fingers flying across the keyboard. "The station doesn’t have the power to
            fire a shot of this magnitude."
        </p>
        <p>
            Commander Harris's heart sank. "We can’t let it fail. We’ve come too far."
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava's eyes darted over the screen. "There’s one way… we could reroute the core’s energy, but it’ll fry
            the entire system." She paused, looking up at him. "This place will be destroyed, and we won’t
            survive the process."
        </p>
        <p>
            Harris clenched his fists. "If we don’t do it, billions of people won’t survive."
        </p>
        <p>
            They shared a silent understanding. They had trained for this moment — a time when sacrifice was
            the only option left.
        </p>
        <p>
            As Ava initiated the sequence to reroute the station's power, alarms blared. "This is it," she said,
            glancing at Harris. "Once I hit this, there’s no going back."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do it," Harris replied, his voice steady.
        </p>
        <p>
            The room vibrated violently as the station’s core redirected all its energy into the railgun. The screen lit
            up, showing the massive debris cloud rapidly approaching Earth. Time was running out.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Charging complete," Ava announced, her hand hovering over the trigger. Sweat beaded on her
             forehead as the railgun’s energy reached critical levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Firing in 3… 2… 1…"
        </p>
        <p>
            A blinding light erupted from the ISS as the railgun fired. The shot tore through space,
            cutting into the debris field. One by one, the fragments disintegrated, breaking apart in a cascade of
            fiery explosions. The largest piece shattered just before entering Earth's atmosphere, lighting up the
            sky like fireworks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava and Harris watched from the control room, their bodies weak with exhaustion. "We did it," Harris
            whispered, barely believing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the victory came at a cost. The station was shutting down, the systems overwhelmed by the power
            surge. Sparks flew, and the floor shook beneath them.
        </p>
        <p>
            "It’s over," Ava said softly, collapsing into her seat as the power died around them. The lights
            dimmed, and the station’s life support systems failed. There was no way out.
        </p>
        <p>
            They had saved Earth — but not themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the darkness closed in, Ava allowed herself a moment of peace. The world would go on. Their
            sacrifice had meant something.
        </p>
        <p>
            And for them, that was enough.
