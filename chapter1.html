            The silence in the International Space Station was eerie. It had been days since the Earth had gone quiet. Dr. Ava looked out at the vastness of space, her mind racing. What had happened down there? She tapped the controls, attempting to re-establish communication with NASA, but all she received was static.
        </p>
        <p>
            "It doesn’t make sense," she muttered under her breath. "We were supposed to be getting updates every hour."
        </p>
        <p>
            Commander Harris floated nearby, staring blankly at the Earth through the viewport. The blue marble looked peaceful, but the silence from mission control told another story. "Do you think it’s true?" he finally asked, breaking the uneasy quiet. "The asteroid?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava sighed, turning to face him. "Apophis wasn’t supposed to hit us. All the calculations were clear. Something else is going on." Her voice trembled slightly, betraying the confidence she had always carried. She glanced at the monitors, hoping for any sign of life from Earth, but all was still.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What could it be?" Harris pressed, his voice tinged with unease.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava didn’t have an answer. All the training, all the simulations, none of them had prepared her for this—complete isolation from Earth. "I don’t know," she admitted softly. "But we’re not getting the full picture. Something happened down there, and we need to find out what."
        </p>
        <p>
            Harris floated closer, his gaze never leaving the Earth. "Then we need to prepare for the worst."
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava nodded. "We’ll need to run diagnostics, check the supplies, and see if we can boost our signal. We’re on our own for now."
